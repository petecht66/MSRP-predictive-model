# MSRP-predictive-model
Date Completed for STAT611: May 2, 2025
Last Updated on GitHub: September 2, 2025

This project was an assignment for STAT611: Regression Analysis, which was taught in the Spring of 2025 by Professor Patrick DeFeo. This class is a graduate course within the Statistics department at the University of Delaware.

The overall goal was to determine which vehicle descriptive variables contribute most to the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of a vehicle. The data set, provided by Professor DeFeo, contains a sample of 428 automotive vehicles from the same production year. This data set can be found in both .xlsx and .csv form in the 'data' folder.

The statistical objective was to narrow the data down to one predictive model for the MSRP of a vehicle as a function of vehicle descriptive factors. As a result, multiple statistical methods and topics are used in this statistical analysis. These topics include binary variables, multiple linear regression, stepwise selection, multicollinearity checks of the predictor variables, and a check for interaction among predictors. Once a model was chosen, a residual analysis was conducted for the appropriateness of the model. Data visualizations and appendices are also included.

The full report can be found in both .pdf and .docx form in the 'report' folder. As mentioned in the report, the SAS code was run using SAS On Demand for Academics. To run this code in Visual Studio Code, you must first obtain an SAS extension. I suggest the official extension from SAS themselves. Next, you must create a connection to a modern SAS environment. Finally, make sure that the path to the data set is correct before running any code.
